1. OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (2003, "Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (61)") (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/e3q8)

changed the server from 3306 -> 5306 and it threw that error
changed the port back to what sql is running on with my local host and it worked

2. OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (1045, "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)") (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/e3q8)

i had changed the password so it didnt match and it denied my access. once i changed the password back it worked

3. Traceback (most recent call last):

    'database': db3, # we got db as an argument

i had changed the name of the database argument name and threw that error since it didnt know what db3 is and if i changed it back it works

KeyError: 'database'

got a key error for changing the string name for database and added an extra s by accident. this was fixed once i spelled database correctly
most of the errors i found were either keyerror above, the NameError because something wasnt defined or the operational errors.
